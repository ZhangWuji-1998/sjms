This is the answer about sjms and the problem 1 is solved by me. The detailed problem description and problem solving ideas are present in fold case1 .

# The overall description of the problem 1
complete converage path planning problem（NP hard）

# The overall description of the solving ideas
The solution is consists of three parts. part 1 is calculated by using minimum tree(PRIM) algorithm, part 2 and part 3 are solved by Dijkstra algorithm which is clasical minimum length path planning algorithm.
